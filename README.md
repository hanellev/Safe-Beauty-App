# Safe Beauty

Safe Beauty is a project developed to help users orient themselves in the complicated world of cosmetic products' ingredients. With the help of this simple app users can check if there are any dangerous or potentially harmful ingredients inside!

We use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology powered by GoogleAI and our own database of dangerous ingredients to help every user make informed decisions and stay healthy.
